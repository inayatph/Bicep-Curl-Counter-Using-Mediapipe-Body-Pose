# Bicep Curl Counter using OpenCV and MediaPipe Body Pose

## Overview
- This project utilizes the MediaPipe Body Pose library along with OpenCV for real-time detection and counting of bicep curls. The system captures video input from a webcam and tracks key body joints to detect bicep curl motions. It counts the number of completed curls and displays the count on the screen in real-time.

## Features
- Real-time bicep curl detection and counting.
- Support for webcam input.
- Intuitive user interface displaying the count of completed curls.

## Libraries Used
- MediaPipe Body Pose: Library for human pose detection.
- OpenCV: Library for image and video processing.
