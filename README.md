# Bicep Curl Counter using OpenCV and MediaPipe Body Pose

## Overview
- This project utilizes the MediaPipe Body Pose library along with OpenCV for real-time detection and counting of bicep curls. The system captures video input from a webcam and tracks key body joints to detect bicep curl motions. It counts the number of completed curls and displays the count on the screen in real-time.

## Features
- Real-time bicep curl detection and counting.
- Support for webcam input.
- Intuitive user interface displaying the count of completed curls.

## Libraries Used
- MediaPipe Body Pose: Library for human pose detection.
- OpenCV: Library for image and video processing.

## Usage
- Launch the script bicep_curl_counter.py.
- Position yourself in front of the webcam with your arms extended and holding weights.
- Perform bicep curl motions with your arms.
- The system will detect and count each completed bicep curl, displaying the count on the screen in real-time.

## Customization
- You can adjust parameters such as confidence thresholds or frame rates in the code to suit your preferences.
- Modify the user interface or add additional features as per your requirements.

## Setup Instruction
- Python Environment: Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
- Required Libraries: Install the necessary Python libraries using pip:
- pip install mediapipe opencv-python
- python bicep_curl_counter.py
